            <p> Balloons are deflated
            Guess they look lifeless like me
           <span> We miss you </span> on your side of the bed, mmm
            Still got your things here
            And they stare at me like souvenirs 
            Don't wanna let you out my head  </p>     
          
            <p>  <br> <b> 
            Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
            Said that you love me, but that'll last for never

            Can't get past the taste of your lips <span >(Taste of your lips)</span>
